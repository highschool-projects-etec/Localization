# Mobile Geolocation System with Delphi

This project demonstrates the implementation of GPS-based geolocation features
in a mobile application developed using Delphi. The application retrieves the
device's current location, displays geographic coordinates, performs reverse
geocoding, and shows the position on a map.

The project was created for educational purposes as a practical guide for using
location sensors in mobile applications.

## 📌 Project Overview

The application uses the device's location sensor to capture real-time
latitude and longitude data. This information is displayed on the interface
and used to:

- Show the current location on Google Maps
- Retrieve a full address from geographic coordinates (Reverse Geocoding)

The GPS sensor can be enabled or disabled directly from the user interface.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Delphi (Multi-Device Application)
- FireMonkey (FMX)
- TLocationSensor
- TGeocoder
- Google Maps (via WebBrowser)
- Android / iOS

## ⚙️ Features

- Enable and disable GPS
- Read latitude and longitude
- Configure accuracy and update distance
- Display location on a map
- Reverse geocoding (address from coordinates)
- Organized interface for location data

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as a study and practice exercise covering:
- Mobile GPS sensors
- Event-driven programming
- Map integration
- Reverse geocoding
- Data formatting

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- Continuous map tracking
- Location history
